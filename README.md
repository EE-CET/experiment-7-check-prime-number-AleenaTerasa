# Experiment 7: Check Prime Number

## Problem Statement

Write a program to check whether a given number is **Prime** or not.
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Input Format

* A single integer $n$.

## Output Format

* Print `Prime` if the number is prime.
* Print `Not Prime` if the number is not prime.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
7
```

**Output:**

```text
Prime
```

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
10
```

**Output:**

```text
Not Prime
```

### Explanation
* **7** is only divisible by 1 and 7, so it is Prime.
* **10** is divisible by 1, 2, 5, 10, so it is Not Prime.
